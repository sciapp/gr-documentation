# GR Framework Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the GR framework, hosted at [gr-framework.org](https://gr-framework.org).

If you want to build the documentation locally, you will need the following tools:

- Python 3.6+
- Julia 0.6+
- Doxygen 1.8+
- make

You can then clone this repository and run `make` in its root directory, which will build the documentation in the `build` subdirectory.
