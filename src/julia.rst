Julia Package GR
================

Getting Started
---------------

The *GR* framewok is also available on PyPI:
`https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gr/>`_

The installation method depends on the environment in which GR will
be used. For further information please refer to the :doc:`installation documentation <installation>`.

Once you have installed the GR framework, in Python you simply need to type::

    from gr import pygr
    pygr.plot([0,1,4],[3,2,5])

At this point, you should browse the gallery to get an impression
