Introduction
------------

*GR* is a universal framework for cross-platform visualization applications.
It offers developers a compact, portable and consistent graphics library for
their programs. Applications range from publication quality 2D graphs to the
representation of complex 3D scenes.

----

*GR* is essentially based on an implementation of a Graphical Kernel System (GKS)
and *OpenGL*. As a self-contained system it can quickly and easily be integrated
into existing applications (i.e. using the ``ctypes`` mechanism in
`Python <https://python.org>`_ or direct calls from
`Julia <https://julialang.org>`_ with ``ccall`` syntax).

The *GR* framework can be used in imperative programming systems or integrated
into modern object-oriented systems, in particular those based on GUI toolkits.
*GR* is characterized by its high interoperability and can be used with modern
web technologies and mobile devices. The *GR* framework is especially suitable
for real-time environments.

*GR* was developed by the `Scientific IT-Systems <https://pgi-jcns.fz-juelich.de>`_ group at the `Peter Grünberg Institute <https://www.fz-juelich.de/pgi>`_
at `Forschunsgzentrum Jülich <https://www.fz-juelich.de>`_.
The main development has been done by Josef Heinen who currently maintains
the software.

*GR3* is a software library for simple visualization of 3D scenes.
It was developed by Florian Rhiem as part of his bachelor's thesis.
*GR3* is written in C and can also be used from *Python* or *Julia* through
a wrapper module.

Starting with release 0.6 *GR* can be used as a backend
for `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ and significantly improve
the performance of existing Matplotlib or PyPlot applications written
in Python or Julia, respectively.
In :doc:`this <tutorials/matplotlib>` tutorial section you can find
some examples.

Beginning with version 0.10.0 *GR* supports inline graphics which shows
up in IPython's Qt Console or interactive computing environments for *Python*
and *Julia*, such as `IPython <https://ipython.org>`_ and
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_.
A simple *IPython* notebook example (converted to HTML5) can be found
`here <https://pgi-jcns.fz-juelich.de/pub/doc/700K_460.html>`_.

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to get the very latest version you can clone the
`GR repository <https://github.com/jheinen/gr>`_ from GitHub::

    git clone https://github.com/jheinen/gr

The *GR* framewok is also available on PyPI:
`https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gr/>`_

The installation method depends on the environment in which GR will
be used. For further information please refer to the :doc:`installation documentation <installation>`.

Once you have installed the GR framework, in Python you simply need to type::

    from gr import pygr
    pygr.plot([0,1,4],[3,2,5])

At this point, you should browse the gallery to get an impression
of GR's capabilities.

For the Julia programming language an official
`GR.jl <https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl>`_ package has been registered.
You can add the GR framework to your Julia installation with the
``Pkg.add()`` function:

.. code-block:: julia

    Pkg.add("GR")
    ...
    using GR
    plot([0,1,4],[3,2,5])
